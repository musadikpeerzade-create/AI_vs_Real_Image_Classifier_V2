# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A few quick guidelines:

- Open an issue first to discuss larger changes or new features.
- Keep changes small and focused in pull requests.
- Run the app locally and ensure no obvious runtime errors before submitting a PR.
- If submitting model/weight files, prefer using Git LFS or hosting them externally.

Development checklist

- Create a branch named `feature/your-change`.
- Add tests where appropriate (not required for tiny UI tweaks).
- Submit a PR with a clear description of the change and testing steps.
